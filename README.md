Here is the source code to an electronic enigma replica described at
http://meinEnigma.com

It is a replica of the german enigma machine used during WWII to encrypt military 
messages. The intent is that it will look and feel as close as economically possible
like the original enigma, that includes wheels that you can rotate and a plug board.
It does also have features like serial interface and possible to store multiple key settings.

The prototype is done and so is the first PCB version, just missing documentation now.
