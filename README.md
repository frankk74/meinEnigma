Here is the source code to an electronic enigma replica described at
http://meinEnigma.com

It is a physical electronic version of the german enigma machine used during
WWII to encrypt military messages. The intent is that it will look as close as
economically possible like the original enigma, that includes wheels that you
can rotate and a plug board.

The first prototype is getting built and while it will electrically be correct
the look will not be the final version and it's done on protoboard instead of
custom PCB.

Once the physical/electrical part is proven to work schematics will be posted
here.
