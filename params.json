  "body": "# myEnigma\r\nHere is the source code to an electronic enigma replica described at\r\nhttp://meinEnigma.com\r\n\r\nIt is a physical electronic version of the german enigma machine used during WWII to encrypt military messages. The intent is that it will look as close as economically possible like the original enigma, that includes wheels that you can rotate and a plug board.\r\n\r\nThe first prototype is getting built and while it will electrically be correct the look will not be the final version and it's done on protoboard instead of custom PCB.\r\n\r\nOnce the physical/electrical part is proven to work schematics will be posted here.\r\n",
